# Image-Classification
Classification of the traffic sign images from German traffic sign recognition benchmark (GTSRB) dataset into various classes.

*	The recognition and classification of GTSRB dataset was done using convolution neural network and the model was trained using Keras framework.
*	The proposed Model for traffic sign classification yielded an accuracy of 98.2 percent. This has been implemented using Tensor Flow frameworks â€“ open source python library
